# Word Master — Greek version

🔗 https://dspinellis.github.io/word-master/

Heavily inspired by [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/), Word Master is a word guessing game similar to Mastermind.
This Greek word version is almost completely based on the
[original English word version](https://github.com/octokatherine/word-master),
which can be played [here](https://octokatherine.github.io/word-master/).

The original author of Word Master,
[Katherine Peterson](https://github.com/octokatherine),
created it because she loved Wordle,
but the once a day limit left her wanting more.
I forked her version and converted it to use Greek words,
because I love the Greek language,
and have been writing software to support Greek for the past 40 years.
I was also fortunate to use the, now widely adopted, Greek dictionary originally
created by Giannis Mitalas and Nikos Seraskeris as a
[thesis project](https://www2.dmst.aueb.gr/dds/sw/greek/ispell/)
I supervised at the University of the Aegean in 1999.

## Rules

- Green: The letter is correct, in the correct position.
