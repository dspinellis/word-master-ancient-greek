# Word Master

Heavily inspired by [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/), Word Master is a word guessing game similar to Mastermind.
The original author  [Katherine Peterson](https://github.com/octokatherine)
created this because she loved Wordle,
but the once a day limit left her wanting more.
I forked this and converted it to Greek words, because I love the Greek
language, and have been converting software to support Greek for
as long as I remember myself programming.

## Rules

You have 6 guesses to guess the correct word.
Each guess can be any valid word.

After submitting a guess, the letters will turn gray, green, or yellow.

- Green: The letter is correct, in the correct position.
- Yellow: The letter is correct, but in the wrong position.
- Gray: The letter is incorrect.
